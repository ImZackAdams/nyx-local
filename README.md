# nyx-local

No servers. No surveillance. No attack surface.

This is a payment protocol that runs entirely in a browser tab.  
Write some text. Generate an HTML file. Send it to someone. They open it. They pay you. That’s it.

---

## what

Nyx-local turns a static HTML file into a payment terminal.
It’s like Stripe, if Stripe fit in an email attachment.

All logic runs in your browser.
No backend = no downtime.
No accounts = no identity leaks.
No middlemen = all margin is yours.

Your payment processor is now a static asset.

---

## why

Because they told us crypto was digital cash,
but somehow we’re still signing forms, surrendering our identities, and giving up 3% of every transaction to some rent seeker in a Patagonia vest.

Because permissionless doesn’t mean “sign up first.”
Because p2p shouldn’t require a backend.
Because we don’t need a startup to tell us how to pay each other.

The browser is the infrastructure now.

## how

1. Open `builder/index.html`
2. Fill in recipient, amount, label
3. Download the generated HTML checkout file
4. Send it to someone
5. They open it in a browser and pay you with their wallet

No hosting required. Works offline. Send it over IPFS, email, or sneakernet.
